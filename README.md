# Java Weather Application

This is a weather application that aims to mock an API for weather based on cities around the world. 

The structure of this project will be based on the Spring Boot Controller-Service-Repository pattern. There will be 
a User interface in the console that will allow a client/user to enter a city and receive weather information (in JSON) about that particular city.
